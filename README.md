# ML-Based Energy Consumption Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict energy consumption based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and historical usage data. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model to assist in optimizing energy usage and reducing costs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing  
- Scikit-Learn for model training  
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional) for deep learning models  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization  
- Flask (if deploying as a web app)  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of historical energy consumption data, including:
- Timestamp  
- Temperature & humidity  
- Power consumption (kWh)  
- Appliance usage patterns  
- Weather conditions  

## 🚀 Model & Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing trends and correlations.  
3. **Model Selection** – Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning models (LSTMs for time series).  
4. **Training & Evaluation** – Using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to measure accuracy.  
5. **Deployment** – Optional deployment via Flask, FastAPI, or a cloud-based service.
